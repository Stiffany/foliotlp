Hello!
i'm Tiffany Palermo,
a Lead UX UI Designer & Developer,
with 27 years of experience in the technology sector. 
I'm passionate about Design Safety, inclusive design, designing for cognitive bias, accessibility and situational accessibility. 
I'm at my best when my technical experience is leveraged effectively to contribute actuals on a project.

My folio is a evolving piece of work. 
In the coming month I will be updating my content.
I will also introduce a navigation. The navigation may take shape in the form of breadcrumbs or navs or tab UI components. 
I have a lot of work and not much room. I'm not too keen on hamburger menus or dropdowns they can be unforgiving and should be large.
I used the Bootstrap 5.1 framework for consistent structure and stability. 
I'm bored with Material UI.
Stay tuned for my art deco DLS and DSM.
