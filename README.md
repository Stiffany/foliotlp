Hello!
i'm Tiffany Palermo,
a Lead UX UI Designer & Developer,
with 27 years of experience in the technology sector. 
I'm passionate about Design Safety, inclusive design, designing for cognitive bias, accessibility and situational accessibility. 
I'm at my best when my technical experience is leveraged effectively to contribute actuals on a project.

My folio is a evolving piece of work. 
In the coming month I will be updating my content.
I will also introduce a navigation. The navigation may take shape in the form of breadcrumbs or navs or tab UI components. 
I have a lot of work and not much room. I'm not too keen on hamburger menus or dropdowns they can be unforgiving and should be large.
I used the Bootstrap 5.1 framework for consistent structure and stability. 
I'm bored with Material UI.
Stay tuned for my art deco DLS and DSM.

**Instructions**

go to Github https://github.com/Stiffany/foliotlp

Open terminal, you should see your mac book name Yourname-MacBook-Pro-2:directory tlp$

Run this command tlp$ **cd Desktop/** or tlp$ **cd ../** we use "cd" to change our directory to the Desktop.

Then run the command tlp$ **mkdir webproject** webproject being the name of the folder where your local files will live.

We used tlp$ **mkdir** to create a folder for our project. It doesnt have to be webproject it can be whatever you like.

After creating a folder, you need to navigate into it, so once again run the command tlp$ **cd webproject** once your in webproject you can begin creating files and more folders.

To create files use the Touch command. Creating a file with Terminal is super easy. All you have to do is type "touch" followed by the name of the file that you wish to create.

Yourname-MacBook-Pro-2:webproject tlp$ **touch index.html**

If you've made more directories and more files in directories you'll need to change directory to get back to the root of your webproject folder so run the command tlp$ **ls** then run tlp$ **cd /webproject** or tlp$ **cd ../**

Enter tlp$ **git clone https://github.com/Stiffany/foliotlp.git**

This will pull my repo down on to your local folder.

Now go and do what you want to my website.

Also take note of my accessibility smarts. Accessibility plays a major role in being more inclusive and upping your google ranking
